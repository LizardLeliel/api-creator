# Rapid Prototype API Creator

Welcome to the Rapid Prototype API Creator!
-------------------------------------------

It can be quite a bit to setup an API for very basic use cases. You have to set up a database and then write the server to accept all the get and post requests and such, despite how simple they are. Wouldn't it be easy to configure all that from a browser so you can test an idea?

This website represents a UI for a theoritical service where you can create Schemas, instances of Schemas, and the various api actions used to modify them! It would take care of simple use-case server-side validation too.

That being said, not only is this website a work in progress, there is no backend currently. On top of that, the purpose behind this was to learn/practice Vude and present a demonstration of said skill. That being said, I do want to develop this idea until something that can be useful and practical.

So far, only Schemas are implemented in limited capacity.
