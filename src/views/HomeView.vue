    <h1> Welcome to the Rapid Prototype API Creator! </h1>

    <p>
      It can be quite a bit to setup an API for very basic use cases, setting up a database and then the server to accept all the get and post requests and such.
      Wouldn't it be easy to configure all that from a browser?
    </p>

    <p>
      So with that, this website represents a UI for a theoritical service where you can create Schemas, data instances of Schemas, and various api actions used to modify them!
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, not only is this website a work in progress, there is no backend currently. On top of that, the purpose behind this is to learn and practice Vue
      with a real-world application - however, I would like to develop this idea further into something practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focus is put into implementing schemas. "Objects" and especially "Actions" may not be implemented for a long while, since after Schemas are complete, I feel like I have achieved my 
      goal of learning Vue - I'd be repeating what I've already done implementing those instead of doing new problems.
